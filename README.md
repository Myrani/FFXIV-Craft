# FFXIV-Craft
An FFXIV queue crafting system/manager : more than a macro repeater, this one can swap jobs and do custom orders, wanna craft 200 planks, ingots 
or anything else in any quantities while you sleep ? now, you can ! 

This project was born on a whim, didn't find any good craft manager that wasn't either just a macro repeater or a botting soft, had some time, so I made my own !

The soft is still in beta, all the main functions are available but if you find any bug, please do report them ! even smaller ones !

If you just want to use the software and are not interested in the code, all good !

  - Just use the .exe file like a regular program and enjoy !  

Non standard python3 library used for any potential tweeks you wanna add !

  - Quick install-All command : 
  
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
